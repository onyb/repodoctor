Contributing
------------

There are a lot of things we need help with. If you are a beginner, you might want to check for issues with tags like "beginner-task".
You can also give us a hand with feature additions, and bug fixes during Mozilla Science Lab sprints.
Get in touch if you are interested in contributing during **Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016**, so that we can chalk out a roadmap and assign you tasks.

Some possible enhancement ideas are:
- Improve the UI/UX of the webapp in general. We need help moving to AngularJS or React.
- Add more health checks. Create a new issue to discuss about it.
- Integrate the API with Shields badges for GitHub.
